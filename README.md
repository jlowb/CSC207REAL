# CSC207REAL

1. Project Description:

Our group is currently considering the development of a music player application as part of our computer science project. Our preliminary concept for this application involves the implementation of several key features, including the ability to create playlists, establish a friends system, and provide users with the capability to upload their music to the platform.

6. A list of any technical problems blocking progress:

Technical issues: We initially encountered issues with a 401 error, indicating that the URL was invalid (in our case, the API key was incorrectly entered). I found it quite useful to examine other examples of API calls. One that particularly aided me was studying JokeAPI and how the URL was constructed, along with how the various parameters were combined. After reviewing these examples, our team successfully obtained an output from the Musixmatch API, as shown in the image.
