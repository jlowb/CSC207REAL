## User Stories:

- Larry is a depressed 19 year old male in college. But, last month he discovered an amazing new passion. Taylor Swift! 
Larry has always heard of Taylor Swift, but due to the patriarchy and societal pressures on masculinity, he never
embraced Taylor's greatness. However, down on his luck, he finally decided to bite the bullet and listened to 
"Shake it Off." The lyrics spoke deeply to Larry, especially the part where she said "Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake," which is a commentary on late stage capitalism and its impact on the flexibility of modern man in 
life. Larry seeks a place where he can freely express his love for the goddess that is the Swift, without being shunned
by society. Swiftify, as an anonymous music player and discussion board for her Swiftness, is just the place for Larry, 
as not only can he listen to the Swifter, but he can also discuss her with fellow Swifties. Larry's main use case would be
the discussions on each song.
